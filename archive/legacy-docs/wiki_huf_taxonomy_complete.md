## How to use this document

This is the single reference for every classification system HUF uses. It is organized in eight layers. Each layer is self-contained. A reader who needs only the failure mode taxonomy can read Section 3 without reading anything else. A reader building a pilot deployment needs Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 in sequence.

Every term used in the Handbook (v1.2.0), the mathematics paper, the governance state observer paper, and the case studies resolves to an entry in this document. If a term appears in any of those documents and is not here, that is a gap to be filed.

## Layer 1 — Monitoring Category Taxonomy

The four monitoring categories define what type of reference the monitoring instrument uses. The first three are established in the ecological monitoring literature. The fourth is introduced by HUF.

| ID | Name | Reference type | Primary question | Intentional/silent distinction | Cross-cycle traceability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MC-1 | Passive monitoring | None — unstructured observation | What is happening? | Absent | Incidental |
| MC-2 | Mandated monitoring | External legal threshold | Is the threshold breached? | Absent | Trend detection only |
| MC-3 | Question-driven monitoring | Conceptual model | Does the model hold? | Absent | Within hypothesis window |
| MC-4 | Ratio state monitoring | System's own declared intent | Is declared intent being met? | **Primary output** | **Structural — all cycles** |

**MC-4 canonical name: Ratio State Monitoring** — approved by the operator, February 2026. Name locked for literature submission.

**MC-4 defining properties:**
- Self-referential: uses the system's own declared priorities as the reference
- Non-invasive: reads existing outputs, requires no new data collection
- Model-free: requires no mathematical model of the system's dynamics
- Bidirectional: detects concentration and fragmentation under the same constraint
- Cross-cycle: produces a traceable governance record across all reporting periods

**Recommended policy framing for MC-4:** "Ratio state monitoring provides a cross-cycle ledger of declared intent and observed allocation; it is a governance diagnostic, not a replacement for site-level assessment."

---

## Layer 2 — Core Vocabulary

All terms are defined as they appear in the Handbook. Terms are listed in dependency order — each term is defined only using terms already defined above it.

| Term | Definition | First introduced |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget ceiling** | The total of a finite-budget system, indexed to 1.0. The ceiling is fixed; it does not grow or shrink with usage. | Chapter 1 |
| **Element** | Any constituent of a portfolio that holds a share of the budget ceiling. Minimum: two elements. | Chapter 1 |
| **Share (ρᵢ)** | An element's proportional portion of the budget ceiling at a given point in time. Always a ratio, never an absolute. ρᵢ = mᵢ / M where M = Σmⱼ. | Chapter 2 |
| **Ratio state** | The complete description of a finite-budget system at a point in time, expressed as a vector of shares summing to 1.0. | Chapter 1 |
| **Unity constraint** | Σᵢ ρᵢ = 1.0. The foundational constraint of HUF. Satisfied by every valid portfolio state. | Chapter 2 |
| **Declared weight** | The share an operator states each element should hold, prior to observation. Also sums to 1.0. | Chapter 3 |
| **Observed share** | The share an element actually holds in the current ratio state, computed from the system's declared outputs. | Chapter 3 |
| **Drift gap** | The absolute difference between an element's declared weight and its observed share: \|ρᵢ_declared − ρᵢ_observed\|. | Chapter 3 |
| **Mean drift gap** | The average drift gap across all elements: (1/n) Σᵢ \|ρᵢ_declared − ρᵢ_observed\|. Expressed in percentage points (pp). | Chapter 10 |
| **Intentional reweighting** | A change in ratio state traceable to a recorded governance decision. | Chapter 3 |
| **Silent drift** | A change in ratio state not traceable to any recorded decision. The primary detection target of HUF. | Chapter 3 |
| **Leverage** | The reciprocal of an element's observed share: leverage = 1/ρᵢ. Unitless. Measures sensitivity to removal or under-resourcing. | Chapter 6 |
| **PROOF line** | The minimum number of elements required to hold a specified fraction (default 80%) of portfolio mass. Lower = more concentrated. | Chapter 10 |
| **System Q** | The ratio of an element's characteristic contribution period to its contribution bandwidth. High-Q elements contribute specifically and cyclically; low-Q elements contribute broadly and steadily. | Chapter 6 |
| **Ground state** | The portfolio condition in which mean drift gap approaches zero, all allocation change is declared, and the feedback loop is self-correcting. | Chapter 7 |
| **Action window** | The period during which correction of observed drift is cheapest — open when drift is detectable and before it compounds to the point where correction cost is disproportionate. | Case Study D.1 |
| **Ratio blindness** | The systematic failure that occurs when a finite-budget system is managed using absolute metrics. Root cause of all six failure modes. | Chapter 1 |
| **Orphan element** | An element whose share has declined to the point where it receives no meaningful governance attention, without a recorded decision justifying the decline. | Chapter 10 |
| **Data age** | The time elapsed since the most recent verified data was collected for an element's metrics. Older data degrades the accuracy of share computation. | Chapter 10 |
| **Institutional memory** | The accumulated record of a governance system's ratio states, declared intents, and responses across all reporting cycles. A byproduct of consistent HUF application. | Concept expansion |

---

## Layer 3 — Failure Mode Taxonomy

Six failure modes, each structurally invisible to all three established monitoring categories. Listed in progression order — later modes are typically consequences of earlier ones left unaddressed.

| ID | Name | Definition | Root cause | Detection artifact | Operational flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FM-1** | Ratio Blindness | Managing a finite-budget system by absolute metrics, ignoring the relational structure that determines each element's actual contribution. | Using absolute measures where only ratios are meaningful. | Portfolio share table; mean drift gap | Mean drift gap > 5pp threshold |
| **FM-2** | Silent Reweighting | Gradual allocation drift occurring below the threshold of formal governance decisions. No policy changes. No declared priorities revised. Administrative gravity operating unchecked. | Absence of the intentional/silent classification mechanism. | Portfolio change log | Unattributed share shift across consecutive cycles |
| **FM-3** | Snapshot Error | Systematic underestimation of high-Q elements by single-cycle observation. Phase read as contribution. Trough read as absence. | Observation window shorter than the element's characteristic period. | Data-age flag; leverage column | High-leverage element with data age > domain threshold |
| **FM-4** | Concentration Trap | Portfolio allocating an increasing share to a decreasing number of dominant elements. Efficient short-term, fragile long-term. Recovery capacity lost silently. | FM-2 allowed to run in the concentration direction without detection. | PROOF line trend | PROOF line ≤ 2 or decreasing across cycles |
| **FM-5** | Fragmentation Spiral | Portfolio allocating sub-threshold attention to too many elements simultaneously. Each element receives some attention; no element receives effective attention. | FM-2 allowed to run in the fragmentation direction without detection. | Reciprocal PROOF line; leverage distribution | Many high-leverage small shares clustering near lower threshold |
| **FM-6** | Orphan Element | An element present on paper but effectively outside the governance system — no management plan updates, no monitoring visits, no meaningful resource allocation. | FM-4 or FM-5 carried to a specific element endpoint. | Coverage record; Orphan Alert | Element share declining across Z cycles with no declared rationale (default Z=2) |

**Failure mode progression notes:**
- FM-1 is the enabling condition. All subsequent failure modes require FM-1 to be operating.
- FM-2 is the mechanism. FM-3, FM-4, FM-5, and FM-6 are all consequences of FM-2 in specific contexts.
- FM-3 amplifies FM-2: snapshot errors make high-Q elements look like they are responding poorly to reduced investment, confirming the misallocation that caused their reduction.
- FM-4 and FM-5 are directional variants of the same drift mechanism — concentration toward a few dominant elements (FM-4) or diffusion across too many small ones (FM-5).
- FM-6 is the terminal state of either FM-4 (specific element crowded out by dominant ones) or FM-5 (specific element lost in fragmentation noise).

## Layer 4 — Artifact Taxonomy

The four standard outputs produced by HUF at each reporting cycle. All four are plain tabular outputs in CSV format. All four attach to existing governance reporting structures.

### A-1: Portfolio Share Table

**Function:** instantaneous snapshot of system ratio state.
**Contents:** each element's observed share (ρᵢ) as a percentage of the total portfolio, leverage value, leverage flag, and data age warning.
**Standard columns:**

```
Site_ID | Site_Name | Area_ha | Metric_Endemism | Declared_Share |
Observed_Share | Portfolio_Share_Pct | Leverage | Leverage_Flag |
Data_Year | Data_Age_Warning
```

**Attaches to:** National Report annexes, River Basin Management Plan appendices, budget allocation tables.

---

### A-2: Trace Report

**Function:** records the declared reasoning behind the current allocation.
**Contents:** which priorities were declared, by which governance actors, with what rationale, under what data age constraints, and how the unity constraint was enforced.
**Standard columns:**

```
Cycle_ID | Site_ID | Site_Name | Declared_Share | Declared_By |
Declared_Timestamp | Rationale | Data_Provenance | Metric_Definitions |
Unity_Check_Pass
```

**Minimum metadata required per declaration:**
- Declaration timestamp
- Declaring authority (name and role)
- Metric definitions and units
- Data provenance (source filename and retrieval date)

**Attaches to:** existing decision records, policy documents, management plan annexes.

---

### A-3: Portfolio Change Log

**Function:** drift detection — compares current cycle state to previous cycle state.
**Contents:** which elements changed share, by how much, classified as intentional or silent.
**Standard columns:**

```
Cycle_ID | Site_ID | Site_Name | Share_Previous | Share_Current |
Delta | Classification | Trace_Reference | Action_Flag | Action_Notes
```

**Action_Flag values:**
- `None` — no significant change, or change within declared tolerance
- `Intentional_Reweighting` — change traceable to a recorded decision in trace report
- `Correction` — silent drift detected and corrected; correction declared
- `Non_Response` — silent drift detected; no corrective action taken

**Attaches to:** governance review documents, audit trails, handover packages.

---

### A-4: Coverage Record

**Function:** accountability trail for deprioritization decisions.
**Contents:** elements that received reduced focus, by what magnitude, against what criteria, with what declared reasoning.
**Standard columns:**

```
Cycle_ID | Site_ID | Site_Name | Share_Decline_Pct | Decline_Reason |
Criteria_Used | Declared_By | Orphan_Alert | Notes
```

**Orphan Alert trigger (default for Ramsar):** element share declining >50% across 2 consecutive cycles without declared rationale.
**Domain-configurable:** the Y% and Z cycles thresholds are domain-specific. Set Y and Z per pilot design and record the configuration in the trace report.

**Attaches to:** National Report annexes, audit documentation, funding justification files.

## Layer 5 — Detection Threshold Taxonomy

Operational thresholds that classify ratio states and trigger governance responses. All thresholds are configurable per domain; default values shown are for the Ramsar wetland portfolio pilot.

| Metric | Default threshold | Classification | Governance response | Calibration status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mean drift gap | < 2pp | Ground state / near ground state | No action required | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Mean drift gap | 2pp – 5pp | Action window open | Monitor next cycle; prepare declaration | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Mean drift gap | > 5pp | Active drift — intervention required | Declare correction or intentional reweighting | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| PROOF line | ≥ 3 | Healthy distribution | No action required | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| PROOF line | = 2 | Concentration warning | Flag; review dominant element allocation | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| PROOF line | = 1 or decreasing | Concentration trap forming | Immediate governance review | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Leverage | < 10 | Low-Q element | Standard monitoring | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Leverage | 10–100 | Medium-Q element | Phase-aware monitoring — check data age | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Leverage | > 100 | High-Q element | High-leverage flag — do not reduce without cycle analysis | *Ramsar-pilot default — calibrate from Phase D data before production use in other domains* |
| Data age | Within domain threshold | Current | No penalty | *Domain-specific — set per deployment; Ramsar default = 5 years* |
| Data age | > domain threshold | Stale | Increase contribution to error budget; flag in share table | *Domain-specific — set per deployment; Ramsar default = 5 years* |
| Orphan alert | Share decline > 50% across 2 cycles, no declared rationale | Orphan risk | Immediate coverage record entry; escalate | *Ramsar-pilot default (Y=50%, Z=2) — configure per domain deployment* |

**Domain-specific threshold configuration notes:**
- Ramsar pilot: data age threshold = 5 years (aligned to RIS update cycle)
- Software retrieval pipeline: data age threshold = 30 days (document embedding freshness)
- Municipal budget: data age threshold = 1 fiscal year (aligned to budget cycle)

## Layer 6 — Response Taxonomy

Three governance response types to detected drift. Classification determines the required documentation and escalation path.

| Response type | Trigger | Required documentation | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Intentional reweighting** | Silent drift detected; operator determines it reflects a genuine priority change | Declare rationale in trace report; update declared weights; record in change log as `Intentional_Reweighting` | None — decision recorded, cycle closes |
| **Silent drift correction** | Silent drift detected; no governance decision produced it | Declare correction in trace report; record root cause; log remediation steps; update coverage record | None if corrected within one cycle; escalate if correction not implemented by next cycle |
| **Non-response** | Silent drift detected; no action taken | Record absence of corrective action in change log as `Non_Response` | Per governance rules: internal audit, oversight body notification, or public disclosure as appropriate to domain |

**Escalation principle:** non-response to detected drift is itself a governance event. The portfolio change log records it. Persistent non-response across multiple cycles creates an auditable record of inaction. The instrument does not compel correction; it makes non-correction visible and attributable.

---

## Layer 7 — Compliance Classification Taxonomy

Compliance states for the HUF Compliance Diagnostic (Chapter 10 of Handbook v1.2.0). Eight tests (T1–T8) mapped to vocabulary terms and failure modes.

| Test | Name | Passes when | Failure mode detected | Vocabulary terms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Unity constraint | Σρ = 1.0; budget ceiling fully accounted | FM-1 | budget ceiling, share, ratio state |
| T2 | Declared weights | Every element has a declared weight; declared weights also sum to 1.0 | FM-2 | declared weight, silent drift, intentional reweighting |
| T3 | Drift classification | Every significant share gap between declared and observed is classified as intentional or silent | FM-2 | silent drift, intentional reweighting |
| T4 | Concentration | PROOF line computed; no unaddressed concentration trend | FM-4 | PROOF line, ratio blindness |
| T5 | Fragmentation | Reciprocal PROOF computed; no unaddressed fragmentation | FM-5 | leverage, fragmentation spiral |
| T6 | Coverage | Coverage record present; all deprioritization decisions documented | FM-6 | coverage record, orphan element |
| T7 | Data age | All inputs have recorded data age; stale inputs flagged | FM-3 | data age, system Q, snapshot error |
| T8 | Ground state | Mean drift gap computed and classified; action window status recorded | All FM | mean drift gap, ground state, action window |

**Compliance classifications:**
- **HUF Compliant:** passes all eight tests
- **HUF Capable:** passes T1, T2, T3; one or more of T4–T8 not yet implemented; remediation path documented
- **HUF Registered:** system is in the HUF record but has not yet completed compliance diagnostic; baseline data collection in progress
- **Non-compliant:** fails T1 or T2 (unity constraint or declared weight test); fundamental preconditions not met

---

## Layer 8 — Convergence Stage Taxonomy

The seven-cycle convergence model describes what a portfolio governance system experiences as it approaches the ground state. Each stage has observable properties in the portfolio change log.

| Stage | Cycle range | Observable properties | Governance posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | Cycle 1 | Portfolio share table established; no change log (no previous cycle). Mean drift gap is baseline reading against declared weights — not a change signal. | Establish declared weights; produce four artifacts; record data provenance. |
| **Trajectory establishment** | Cycles 2–3 | Change log shows first inter-cycle comparison. Trajectory visible: converging, diverging, or stable. Q-factor patterns beginning to emerge. | Respond to detected drift; begin classifying changes as intentional or silent. |
| **Q-factor characterization** | Cycles 4–6 | Sufficient history to identify element characteristic periods. High-Q elements visible in leverage column and cycle-over-cycle share analysis. Orphan alerts issued if any elements approaching orphan threshold. | Phase-aware allocation decisions; cross-cycle comparison before any high-Q element is deprioritized. |
| **Ground state approach** | Cycles 7+ | Mean drift gap declining trend. PROOF line stable or improving. Persistent silent drift in any element triggering prompt correction. Institutional memory spanning multiple governance generations. | Self-correcting feedback loop; external intervention declining; portfolio change log primary governance reference. |
| **Ground state reached** | Variable — not a fixed cycle count | Mean drift gap near zero. All allocation change is either declared or corrected within one cycle. No persistent unclassified drift in any element. | Self-governing: governance system generates its own correction signals without external audit requirement. |

**Note on ground state timing:** the convergence rate depends on the Q differential between portfolio elements. A portfolio with all low-Q elements (similar characteristic periods) converges faster. A portfolio with high Q-differential (element cycles spanning orders of magnitude) converges more slowly but reaches a more stable ground state when it arrives.

---

## Layer 9 — Q-Factor Classification

The Q-factor taxonomy provides the vocabulary for discussing element characteristic frequencies in governance terms. Values are indicative; Q classification is domain-specific and should be calibrated from observed cycle data.

| Q class | Leverage range (indicative) | Characteristic period | Governance implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ultra-high Q** | > 500 | Multi-decadal or event-driven | Essentially irreplaceable within any governance horizon; treat removal as permanent |
| **High Q** | 100–500 | Multi-year to decadal | Phase-dependent; requires cross-cycle observation before allocation decisions |
| **Medium Q** | 10–100 | Seasonal to annual | Sensitive to single-cycle snapshot error; verify data age before allocation change |
| **Low Q** | < 10 | Sub-annual or continuous | Broadly functional; visible in most observation windows; resilience elements |

**Examples across domains:**
- Sourdough loaf: yeast = ultra-high Q (leverage 833); flour = low Q (leverage 1.6)
- Croatia Ramsar: Crna Mlaka = high Q (leverage 149); Lonjsko Polje = low Q (leverage 1.8)
- Software retrieval pipeline: single-topic specialist namespace = high Q; general-purpose namespace = low Q

**The irreversibility threshold:** an element with Q class high or ultra-high should not be removed from a portfolio based on a single-cycle snapshot. The action of removal may not produce detectable governance consequences until the element's characteristic period has elapsed — at which point recovery may not be possible. Document this risk explicitly in the coverage record for any high-Q element deprioritization.

---

## Layer 10 — Institutional Memory Theorem (Operational Statement)

*Derived from the concept expansion, February 2026. Formally proved in HUF Volume 2 Mathematics Compendium v1.0 (Proposition 7.5). Proof complete within framework assumptions.*

**Statement:** A governance system operating under the fourth monitoring category — Ratio State Monitoring accumulates institutional memory at the rate of one portfolio state per reporting cycle, permanently and without additional effort. After n cycles, the institution holds an n-period governance trajectory that is independent of personnel turnover, organizational restructuring, or administrative disruption.

**Operational implications:**
- Portfolio change logs must be treated as primary governance records, not administrative byproducts
- Archival retention and searchable indexing of change logs must be specified in governance protocols
- Change logs must be included in governance handover packages and audit procedures
- The value of the log is non-linear with cycle count: the first two or three cycles are thin; by cycle six or seven the trajectory is the most valuable governance document the institution possesses

**What the theorem does not claim:** the record is only as accurate as the declarations that feed it. Under-reporting, fabricated site-level data, or deliberate misrepresentation of declared weights will produce an accurate record of a false history. The institutional memory theorem records what was declared and what was observed. It does not independently verify either.

---

## Layer 11 — Pilot Evaluation Rubric

For use in the Croatia pilot and transferable to any domain deployment.

| Metric | How to measure | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Detection precision | Proportion of flagged shifts confirmed as silent reweighting after stakeholder review | ≥ 0.80 |
| False positive rate | Flagged events judged non-actionable / total flagged events | ≤ 0.25 |
| Operational usability | Median minutes for policy officer to interpret artifacts and produce 1-page briefing | ≤ 60 minutes |
| Onboarding cost | Staff hours for baseline run; per-cycle hours for repeat | Baseline ≤ 40 hours; repeat ≤ 8 hours |
| Policy actionability | Artifacts that produced a recorded governance action / total artifacts presented | ≥ 0.25 |
| Data provenance completeness | Proportion of inputs with provenance metadata (source filename + retrieval date) | 1.0 (100%) |
| Stakeholder confidence | Median Likert (1–5) among site managers and policy officers that artifacts reflect operational reality | Median ≥ 3.5 |

**Evaluation deliverables:** confusion matrix for detection; time and cost table; list of governance actions triggered; recommendations for threshold adjustments and onboarding improvements.

**Site manager survey (7 questions, Likert 1–5 plus open comment):**
1. I find the portfolio share table easy to interpret.
2. The portfolio change log shows me something I could not see before.
3. The trace report provides sufficient context to explain why shares changed.
4. The Leverage_Flag column helps me identify sites that need attention.
5. The data-age warnings are useful for prioritizing verification.
6. The artifacts would change how I prepare National Report annexes.
7. The time required to review the artifacts is acceptable for my role.
8. Did the artifacts prompt any governance action or discussion? (Yes/No — if Yes, short description)
9. What is the single most useful change you would make to the artifacts or presentation? (open text)

Scoring: compute median for Likert items; flag any item with median < 3 for immediate attention.

## Layer 12 — Three-Domain Confirmation Path

**Current status:** THREE-DOMAIN CONFIRMATION COMPLETE. Proposition 7.1 has strong empirical support across three systems with no domain overlap. Exhibit B completed February 2026.

| System | Domain | Budget ceiling | Elements | PROOF line | Highest-Q element | Mean drift gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| System A | Artisanal bread | 1,000g | 5 (flour, water, starter, salt, yeast) | 2 (flour + water = 98.4%) | Yeast — leverage 833 | 1.4pp (near ground state) | Case Study D.1 — confirmed |
| System B | Croatia Ramsar portfolio | 93,000 ha | 5 (Lonjsko, Kopački, Neretva, Crna Mlaka, Vransko) | 2 (Lonjsko + Kopački = 80.0%) | Crna Mlaka — leverage 149 | 4.8pp (action window open) | Case Study D.1 — confirmed |
| System C | Software retrieval pipeline | Total query volume (30-day window) | 4 namespaces (General docs, Technical specs, HUF specialist, Archive/legacy) | 2 (General + Technical = 80.0%) | Archive / legacy — leverage 14.29 | 10.0pp (ACTIVE DRIFT) | **COMPLETE** — Exhibit B, February 2026 |

**Why System C completes the claim:** Systems A and B share structural properties (both are static-at-declaration, both are measured in physical units, both have natural proportional decompositions). System C introduces a domain that operates at a completely different scale (milliseconds to weeks vs. years), with different institutional governance structures, and with drift mechanisms (document aging, embedding updates, query distribution shifts) that are entirely absent from the ecological or material domains. Three-domain confirmation with no structural overlap constitutes strong empirical support for Proposition 7.1.

**Confirmation sentence (Exhibit B, February 2026):** *The HUF Diagnostic Engine applied Tests T1, T4, T5, and T8 to three systems with no domain overlap — an artisanal sourdough loaf (grams, hours), the Croatia Ramsar portfolio (hectares, years), and a software retrieval pipeline (query volume, days to weeks) — and produced coherent, comparable, formally structured results using the same instrument without modification. The unity constraint is domain-invariant. This is Exhibit B.*

## Layer 13 — Grok Mathematical Extensions
*Grok contribution — February 2026 · All items [CONJECTURE] unless marked otherwise*

Mathematical extensions proposed by Grok during the collective review cycle. Each item is labeled [CONJECTURE] indicating it has not been formally proved within the HUF framework. These are candidates for future proof or refutation as the research programme advances.

| ID | Conjecture | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| G.1 | Boundary entropy: portfolio entropy is maximised at the uniform distribution and minimised at full concentration | [CONJECTURE] | Consistent with Shannon entropy bounds; not yet formally proved in HUF framework |
| G.2 | Lyapunov stability: if a declared-weight vector is a fixed point of the governance correction map, then for all sufficiently small perturbations, the system returns to ground state | [CONJECTURE] | Requires formal construction of the Lyapunov function V |
| G.3 | Ecological resilience: Ramsar portfolios governed under the fourth monitoring category will exhibit lower variance in site-level assessment scores across triennial reporting cycles than unmonitored portfolios | [CONJECTURE] | Empirically testable; requires Phase D data |
| G.4 | Ostrom-HUF Axiom Chain 1: every finite collective-action resource with a defined budget ceiling is a valid HUF domain | [CONJECTURE] | Broad claim; partially supported by three-domain confirmation |
| G.5 | Ostrom-HUF Axiom Chain 2: HUF's four artifacts satisfy Ostrom's Design Principles 1 (defined boundaries), 2 (proportional allocation), 4 (monitoring), and 7 (nested governance) | [CONJECTURE] | Requires systematic mapping against all eight Ostrom principles |
| G.6 | Ostrom-HUF Axiom Chain 3: silent drift (FM-2) is the computational analogue of Ostrom's "monitoring failure" in commons governance | [CONJECTURE] | Strong structural argument; formal equivalence not proved |
| G.7 | Ostrom-HUF Axiom Chain 4: the portfolio change log is a sufficient implementation of Ostrom's Design Principle 4 (monitoring by those accountable) | [CONJECTURE] | Plausible; requires comparative analysis against Ostrom case studies |
| G.8 | Ostrom-HUF Axiom Chain 5: a portfolio that consistently achieves ground state satisfies the conditions for Ostrom's self-governing commons | [CONJECTURE] | Connects to Theorem 9.1 convergence result |
| G.9 | Q-factor link: the sensitivity parameter s (declared weight impact on observed share) scales as approximately 1/Q | [CONJECTURE] | Would provide a direct operational link between Q-factor and governance sensitivity |
| G.10 | Drift rate link: the per-cycle drift rate d scales as approximately 1 − 1/Q | [CONJECTURE] | Implies high-Q elements drift more slowly per cycle but accumulate irreversible drift |
| G.11 | Non-linear Lyapunov: a Lyapunov function V exists for the non-linear governance correction map, establishing global asymptotic stability of the ground state | [CONJECTURE] | This is the open non-linear convergence problem; see Vol 2 Part III |
| G.12 | Supply chain extension: HUF detects silent supplier concentration (FM-4) in procurement portfolios with the same instrument as ecological or manufacturing domains | [CONJECTURE] | Partially supported by Layer 16 simulation |
| G.13 | AI governance extension: HUF detects silent model-capability concentration in AI portfolios, flagging under-resourcing of interpretability and bias detection elements | [CONJECTURE] | Proposed by Grok; not yet empirically tested |

**Grok verdicts on previously open questions:**
- Non-linear convergence proof: Grok assessed this as impossible with current tools; recommended collaboration with mathematicians and symbolic simulation as a preparatory step. HUF assessment: consistent with existing open problem statement in Vol 2.
- Ratio State Monitoring (MC-4 name): Grok endorsed the name as precise and aligned with the framework's self-referential nature. RESOLVED — operator approved February 2026.
- Proposition 7.5 formal statement: Grok proposed formalization via Layer 10 expansion. RESOLVED — proved in Vol 2 Mathematics Compendium.

## Layer 15 — Q Factor Complete Derivation

*Formal derivation of System Q and the phase problem. Carried from huf_math_foundations_v2_1_cohesion.docx.*

**Definition:** System Q is defined as the ratio of an element's characteristic contribution period T to its contribution bandwidth B:

    Q = T / B

Where:
- T = the period of the element's characteristic contribution cycle (e.g., fermentation cycle for yeast, endemic species monitoring window for Crna Mlaka, BGA inspection event cycle for Dage X-ray)
- B = the bandwidth of the observation window within which the element's contribution is detectable

**Q-factor domain table:**

| Domain | Element example | T (characteristic period) | B (observation bandwidth) | Q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sourdough | Yeast | 4–12 hours (fermentation) | 0.01–0.02 hours (active window) | ~500–1200 |
| Croatia Ramsar | Crna Mlaka endemic species | Multi-year ecological cycle | ~3 months (survey window) | ~4–12 |
| Software retrieval | Legacy/archive namespace | Months (research event) | Days–weeks (observation window) | ~2–10 |
| Electronics assembly | Dage X-ray (BGA audit) | Weeks–months (batch audit cycle) | Hours (inspection session) | ~10–50 |
| Manufacturing | Quality Control (batch audit) | Weekly cycle | 1–2 days (audit window) | ~3–7 |

**Grok Go/No-Go verdict on Q derivation:** GO — the Q factor derivation is consistent with electrical engineering Q-factor analogy and provides operationally useful governance vocabulary.

**Relationship to governance:** High-Q elements are systematically underweighted by single-cycle observations. The snapshot error (FM-3) is the operational expression of measuring a high-Q element outside its contribution window and interpreting the low observed value as low importance. The coverage record (A-4) and the data-age flag are the governance instruments that mitigate FM-3 for high-Q elements.

## Layer 16 — Supply Chain Application Path
*Grok extension — February 2026 · All items [CONJECTURAL] pending real-data validation*

**System D — Electronics / Pharmaceutical Supply Chain**

| System | Domain | Budget ceiling | Elements | PROOF line | Highest-Q element | Mean drift gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| System D | Electronics manufacturing supply chain | 1,000,000 units (annual procurement volume) | 5 (Raw Materials A, Component Fabricator B, Assembly Partner C, Logistics D, Rare Earth Sourcing E) | 2 (A + B = 82%) | Rare Earth Sourcing E — leverage 250 | 3.5pp (action window open) | Case Study D.3 — simulated |

**Domain threshold configuration** [CONJECTURAL]:
- Data age threshold: 90 days (quarterly inventory cycles)
- Orphan alert: Y = 40%, Z = 3 cycles
- Criticality_Modifier: 0.75 for high-risk chains (pharmaceuticals)

**Test T10 — Resilience Check** [CONJECTURAL]:
Passes when PROOF line ≥ 3 and no high-Q supplier has leverage > 200 without redundancy declaration. Failure mode: FM-4 in critical supply paths. Vocabulary: Leverage, PROOF line.

**Automated Rebalancing (supply chain)** [CONJECTURAL]: Trigger on medium-Q suppliers with drift < 3pp. Rationale via ERP system scripts. Escalation: notify procurement board if unity check fails.

**Pilot path:** Electronics manufacturing or pharmaceutical supply chain with ERP access. Quarterly cycles. Requires ERP data integration. Operator entry point: Fuji customer network (electronics procurement) or direct to EMS facility.

## Layer 17 — Logistics Application Path
*Grok extension — February 2026 · All items [CONJECTURAL] pending real-data validation*

**System E — Global Logistics Network**

| System | Domain | Budget ceiling | Elements | PROOF line | Highest-Q element | Mean drift gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| System E | Global shipping / logistics | 500,000 TEU (annual container throughput) | 5 (Sea Freight A, Air Cargo B, Ground Trucking C, Warehousing D, Last-Mile E) | 2 (A + B = 81%) | Last-Mile Delivery E — leverage 200 | 2.8pp (action window open) | Case Study D.4 — simulated |

**Domain threshold configuration** [CONJECTURAL]:
- Data age threshold: 60 days (bi-monthly routing cycles)
- Orphan alert: Y = 35%, Z = 4 cycles
- Criticality_Modifier: 0.8 for time-sensitive logistics (perishable goods)

**Test T11 — Efficiency Check** [CONJECTURAL]:

## Layer 18 — Manufacturing Application Path
*Grok extension (general) + Operator expansion (electronics assembly) — February 2026*

**System F — Manufacturing (General / Automotive simulation; Electronics Assembly operator-expanded)**

| System | Domain | Budget ceiling | Elements | PROOF line | Highest-Q element | Mean drift gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| System F | Automotive / general manufacturing | 200,000 units (annual output) | 5 (Raw Processing A, Fabrication B, Assembly C, Quality Control D, Packaging E) | 2 (A + B = 80%) | Quality Control D — leverage 16.67 | 3.0pp (action window open) | Case Study D.5 — simulated (general) |

**Domain threshold configuration** [CONJECTURAL — general manufacturing]:
- Data age threshold: 45 days (monthly production cycles)
- Orphan alert: Y = 45%, Z = 3 cycles
- Criticality_Modifier: 0.7 (high-precision manufacturing)

**Electronics assembly threshold configuration** [Operator-calibrated estimate]:
- Data age threshold: 7 days (Dage inspection logs); 1 day (Fuji NXTR Nexim data)
- Orphan alert: Y = 40% (inspection); Y = 30% specifically for X-ray audit
- Criticality_Modifier: 0.5–0.6 for aerospace/automotive electronics; 0.6 for IPC Class 3

**Test T12 — Quality Check** [CONJECTURAL]:
Passes when no high-Q process has leverage > 180 without quality control redundancy declared. Failure mode: FM-3 in production errors. In electronics assembly: directly applies to Dage X-ray inspection allocation. If X-ray audit element exceeds leverage threshold without declared alternative inspection method, T12 fails.

**Automated Rebalancing (manufacturing)** [CONJECTURAL]: Trigger on low-Q assembly processes with drift < 3.5pp via MES scripts. **NOT recommended for high-Q inspection elements (Dage X-ray) — human declaration required for all inspection sampling rate changes.**

**6-cycle convergence simulation** (Grok, weekly cycles, general manufacturing):
| Cycle | Stage | MDG | PROOF line | Key event |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline | 3.0pp | 2 | First declaration; no change log |
| 2–3 | Trajectory | 2.6pp → 2.2pp | 2 | Silent drifts classified; intentional reweighting declared |
| 4–5 | Q-characterisation | 1.8pp → 1.4pp | 2 → 3 | Characteristic periods identified; PROOF line improving |
| 6 | Ground approach | 0.0pp | 3 | Institutional memory: 6 cycles; self-correcting |

**Electronics assembly domain-native application:** See `wiki_manufacturing_electronics_assembly.md` — Fuji NXTR / AIMEX R placement capacity governance, Dage X-ray inspection portfolio, SMT process stage Q-factor mapping, Nexim data integration path, Fuji Japan and Nordson Dage entry points.

## Layer 19 — AI Governance Application Path
*Grok extension — February 2026 · [CONJECTURAL] pending real-data validation*

**System G — AI Model Portfolio**

| System | Domain | Budget ceiling | Elements | PROOF line | Highest-Q element | Mean drift gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| System G | AI governance (model portfolio) | 1,000,000 parameters (total model capacity) | 5 (General A, Specialized B, Interpretability C, Bias Detection D, Deployment E) | 2 (A + B = 82%) | Bias Detection D — leverage 150 | 2.5pp (action window open) | Case Study D.6 — proposed |

**Why AI governance:** Grok identified AI as the domain most likely to benefit from HUF among topics requiring explainable, traceable governance (February 2026). FM-4 (concentration in dominant models), FM-3 (snapshot error in bias detection — high-Q, event-driven), and FM-6 (orphan status for interpretability tools) are all structurally detectable.

**Criticality_Modifier** [CONJECTURAL]: 0.6 suggested for AI systems with fairness-critical deployment (hiring, credit, medical). Triggers high-Q flag at leverage > 60 for bias detection and interpretability elements.

**Pilot path:** AI model management repository with component allocation records. Bi-weekly cycles. Parameter count as budget ceiling.

## Criticality_Modifier — Cross-Domain Threshold Scaling
*Grok extension — [CONJECTURAL] — February 2026*

A domain-specific scaling factor applied to the base leverage threshold (default: high-Q flag at leverage > 100) to trigger earlier escalation in high-consequence domains.

| Domain | Criticality_Modifier | Effective high-Q threshold | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard manufacturing | 0.7 | > 70 | High-precision; early detection preferred |
| Electronics assembly — consumer | 0.6 | > 60 | Component failure consequences |
| Electronics assembly — aerospace/automotive (IPC Class 3) | 0.5 | > 50 | Safety-critical; zero-tolerance for silent inspection drift |
| Pharmaceutical supply chain | 0.75 | > 75 | Regulatory recall risk |
| Power grid / critical infrastructure | 0.5 | > 50 | Societal consequence |
| AI (fairness-critical deployment) | 0.6 | > 60 | Discrimination risk from bias detection orphaning |

**Status:** All values conjectural. Operator must document Criticality_Modifier choice in trace report for each domain deployment. Real calibration from Phase D data.
